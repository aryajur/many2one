Sorry documentation linked below is old. For updated instructions see the code (simple config file example given there). 
The main difference is that you don't have to list all the files to combine anymore. Just the mainfile has to be specified and it automatically finds all the linked files.
For documentation see [here](http://www.amved.com/milindsweb/Many2One.html)
